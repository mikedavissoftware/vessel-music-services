            Having spent well over a decade pursuing a variety of independent ventures, I've cultivated a diverse & exceedingly valuable perspective on technical project management. This perspective allows me to operate with technical & conceptual confidence in the production of audio, film, visual art, and software solutions. In addition to raw technical skills, my time in creative entrepreneurship has lent me a unique awareness of how human & digital systems successfully work together.

            Over the winter of 2022-2023, I attended <a href="https://flatironschool.com/" target="_blank">Flatiron School</a>'s Software Engineering Program on their Denver campus. During this program, my classNamemates came to know me as someone who is both friendly and knowledgeable, even electing me as <strong>Most Likely to Help Anyone Anytime</strong> with the course material. The most prominent example of this was my frequent planning of coding walkthroughs & other group learning sessions, which both reinforced my own learning <strong>and</strong> bolstered my ability to communicate software engineering concepts. Having graduated from this program in February of 2023, I look forward to contributing my technical and interpersonal skills to the ever-evolving field of software development!
