!["Screenshot of this site"](public/vms-project-short-COMP-2.gif)

#### Inspired by [Dopefolio](https://github.com/rammcodes/Dopefolio) by [Ram Maheshwari](https://github.com/rammcodes)

The original single-page HTML template was converted to **React**, in order to ease upscaling and ease the incorporation of using JavaScript.

#### Tech Stack and Other Tools Used:

- React.JS and JSX
- SASS (SCSS)
- Google API (so that VMS can edit the entries on the site)
- [emailjs](https://www.emailjs.com/)

#### Check out the final product [here](https://vesselsound.com/)
